#Site Template For Events
=========================

A simple site that will let orgnizers of small events/confereance/hackthon and option to have their ionformation, registration in one place.

## Demo
 http://bit.ly/html5-lon
 I've used this site for that event.
 
##The major sections:
1. What is the event
2. Where (add some nice map to the event spot + parking)
3. Contact 
4. Reigstration - use google docs. 

In that aspect there is another 'backend' that let you send confirmations, reminders, waiting-list mangement and after the event feedback.
