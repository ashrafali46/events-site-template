#Site Template For Events
=========================

A simple site that will let orgnizers of small events/confereance/hackathon and option to have their ionformation, registration in one place.
Btw, checkout [hackdaymanifesto](https://github.com/greenido/hackdaymanifesto.github.com/blob/master/index.markdown) in order to improve your next hackathon.

 
## The major sections:
1. What is the event?
2. Where (add some nice map to the event spot + parking)?
3. Contact - put here a good channel to communicate (=not your email. It could be slack, twitter, G+)
4. Reigstration - Use google sheet with [Apps script](https://github.com/greenido/events-site-template/blob/master/G-doc-scripts/util.js)

This 'backend' code will let you send emails to the people that registered (confirmations, reminders, waiting-list etc;) and also gain valuable feedback after the event.

## ToDo
  * ServiceWorkers - to enable notification when sessions start.
  * A good example is [devsummit](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devsummit) site that was built for Chrome Summit
  * Add mobile view (foundation).
  
#### Older Todos (2014/3)
  * This will enable users to 'fill' the capabilities of an app.
  * Notifications - for talks you registered.
* Make the site UI 'mobile' with foundation / bootstrap.
* Let users save their 'own' plan for the day.
* Enable the site to run in 'offline' mode:
  * Let the user fill the form and send it when you have connection.
  * Let users 'save' their plan for the event
